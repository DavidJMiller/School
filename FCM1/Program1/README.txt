To compile main.cpp and have all calculations done in double precision type:

	g++ -std=c++14 -DDOUBLE=1 main.cpp

For single precision calculations type

	g++ -std=c++14 -DSINGLE=1 main.cpp

You just have to mess around with the commenting to get what you want. I also included my
graphing source codes but you just execute them by typeing

	python filename.py

Program1.pdf is my writeup.
